            What is a Solar Water Purifier?
          </h3>
          <p className="text-lg font-Rubik">
            A solar water purifier is an advanced water filtration system that
            uses solar energy to remove objectionable elements from raw water.
            Unlike traditional purifiers that rely on fossil fuels or grid
            electricity, these purifiers harness solar power, making them
            environmentally friendly and cost-effective. The purification
            process varies depending on the model, and each system achieves
            different grades of purified water, ensuring clean, safe drinking
            water for households, businesses, and industries.
